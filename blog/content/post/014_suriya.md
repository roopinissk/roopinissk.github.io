Its going to be 3 months since Suriya and I got married. Suriya and I have been together for 8 years now but, somehow feels like we've know each other for longer. I've known suriya from school. Both of us were book worms and we used to exchange a lot of books that friendship grew into something so special that I am grateful for everyday. 

Looking back, our relationship was super unconventional. Suriya and I were in an on and off relationship from 2016 but, in 2018 we put a name on it. He was preparing for CAT exam while he proposed to me, and he wanted to not talk/text until his exams got over. So, after he proposed we did not contact each other for about 4 months. Looking back, it was a weird thing to do. But, felt right to me. Suriya studied in a diiferent city and we used to me only twice or thrice in a year. Both of us were weird equally, we had rules like we would talk only once a week, because it was important to the both of us that we had other things to work on. This went on for atleast a year or two, I even had few of my friends ask me if this was love. Somehow, it never felt weird to the both of us. We were (are) both people constantly working towards a goal. I can see how that kept us together. The relationship was extremely unique, organic and we grew individually and together over the years. Eventually we both knew we wanted to be together which led us to getting married. 

Our wedding was extremely special and personal. We had no fancy photography, we had no fancy designer clothes. My saree blouses were stitched by my mother, my makeup was done by my friends. All I and everyone can think of on my wedding day was laughter because there was so much fun. After the wedding, we drove to the hotel in an old scooter which did not seem odd to me until a friend of mine told me. But, that was just suriya and I, being weird in ways.

I see my relationship with him to be something so rare and so pure. Built with so much resepct and trust. We've seen so much together and we have been through so much together. Suriya is the smartest and the most compassionate person I've ever met and I've learned so much from him and he makes me a better human everyday. There's no one that understands me better. 

Love is when you know that home has never been a place, its how a person makes you feel. And suriya is and will always be my home.
