A couple of days ago, I attended a Women in Science and Medicine event at NYU. I initially thought it would be more of a research and networking event, but it turned out to be something much more inspiring. The panel featured amazing women doctors and researchers who have accomplished incredible things. Rather than focusing solely on research, it was a light yet deeply personal discussion about what it means to be a woman in a patriarchal society.

Growing up in a gender-neutral household, I never felt disadvantaged for being born a girl. For that, I am grateful to my mother and father. Until that day at the event, I hadn’t fully realized that achieving success as a woman is about far more than just skills or talent. The panelists spoke about the subtle everyday gender disparities that exist in professional and personal spaces—things I had never actively noticed before, but now I do. They discussed career growth, education, and the work ethic of women, and I came to a striking realization that I could be rejected for a role, offered a lower salary, or overlooked purely because I am a woman. I had always thought of missed opportunities as a result of a lack of skill, but looking back, maybe not. 

Women are a minority in most professional spaces. A woman’s voice, demeanor, and humility can sometimes be mistaken for weakness or inability. Yet the panelists were all powerful, successful women in leadership roles, many of them also wives and mothers. One of them, a radiation oncologist, was a mother of three! As I looked at these women that day, I realized they are the true superheroes—not Superman, Batman, or any other male figure that society romanticizes. I cant imagine a man multitsking as a woman would. Honestly, I dont understand why we are called a patriarchal society. 

The panelists also spoke about how male colleagues often have a completely different mindset when approaching opportunities, negotiating salaries, or even applying for graduate programs. One researcher mentioned that she often sees female applicants write phrases like “I believe I would be a great fit for this role” or “I hope I can contribute,” whereas male applicants rarely use such language. Instead, their writing is much stronger and confident.

They discussed career breaks, family planning, and the pressure of racing through life as if it were a competition. There will always be self-entitled, overly confident men who seem to waltz through opportunities—but we shouldn’t let that discourage us or hinder our personal growth. The panelists emphasized the importance of being kind, humble, and, most importantly, bold—speaking up for oneself and claiming space in the room.

Overall loved it so much. I left feeling so inspired and powerful for being a woman.
