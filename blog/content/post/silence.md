Something from the book I am reading currently- Song of the cell, made so much sense so, I wanted to record it here. 

The author talks about "great silences" between discoveries; specifically one after the discovery of the gene. Years of silence because everyone is trying to understand and work around the new discovery(s). Streams and valley may seem to be still but, really zoomed in they are flowing. I'd like to apply this to life. 

Day in day out might seem like you are not doing much. But, take a moment to step back and look at the things you are doing, its work everyday. They will amount to a lot.  

"You have to see past flesh (continuous, corporeal and visible) to imagine blood (invisible, corpuscular and discontinuous)"
